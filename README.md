# spotify-clone
This project mirrors the user experience of Spotify using Next.js 13.4 and React. A reliable and secure payment integration is ensured using Stripe, adding a premium feature akin to Spotify's premium service. On the back-end, I have employed Supabase and PostgreSQL to assure efficient data handling and scalable performance. The UI is built with Tailwind CSS, aimed to replicate Spotify's renowned aesthetic while ensuring responsiveness.
